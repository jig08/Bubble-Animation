#Bubble Animation (using JavaScript)

The bubbles in the string scatter about and regroup when the mouse is moved over it.



###How to incorporate in your web page ?

The `main.js` file includes the animation script. 

It can be incorporated in `<html>` by placing the following the lines in the `<head>`:


```
<script 
  type="text/javascript" 
  src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js">
</script>

<script 
  type="text/javascript" 
  src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/bubbles.js">
</script>

<script 
  type="text/javascript" 
  src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/alphabet.js">
</script>
```


and the following in the `<body>`:

```
<script 
  type="text/javascript" 
  src="main.js">
</script>
```
